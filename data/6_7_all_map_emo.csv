Upon asking his reason for not leaving, patient did not respond and simply stared at the RN. Further education by RN on the transfer process led to the patient suddenly attempt to get out of bed and began violently removing clothes and medical devices. RN quickly stopped patient from causing harm from removing devices, attempted education on the importance of the devices and began attempts to replace the gown. A nursing aide entered the room to attempt to help this RN with de-escalation and encouraged patient to put his clothes back on. Attempts were unsuccessful and patient began violently swinging his arms to hit the aide. This RN stepped in to stop patient's arms in which patient grabbed with both hands RN's scrub tip and attempted to pull RN to him. Aide immediately activated the strong line. Patient continued to grasp on RN clothes for approximately 30 seconds despite stern instructions to release RN. Charge RN arrived at bedside for assessment and further de-escalation attempts. Security arrived soon after. Patient continued to ignore Charge RN. However, after a few minutes, patient asked where she wanted him. Patient then stood up from bed, despite instructions from Charge RN to lay back down in bed, replaced gown, and unsteadily walked to bed brought in by transport staff. This RN closely escorted patient to the bed to prevent risk of fall, prepped the bed for transport, then transported the patient to new room on Grant 5. Event was reported to the new bedside RN.

He attempted to corner me in his room and said something along the lines of, ""What the fuck are you doing with my pillow. You bitch! Don't take my stuff, put that back NOW!"". I explained that I was just trying to make him comfortable and put the pillow back on his bed. I asked if he would like a blanket for transport and he screamed ""fuck no!"".

I explained that I unfortunately need to be able to move the stretcher in different settings to ensure a safe transport.

I was notified by NP of the following: ""So Friday afternoon, I got a phone call at first it was someone who thought they had the wrong number, I was driving didn't think anything of it. Then they sent a text asking if I was ""NP"", I said it was. I got 4 back to back texts, it was a patient I saw at Inland, when I did not respond in the 30 seconds after, she called me. I asked her how she got my number as it is my personal cell phone. She said she found it on the internet. I told her she needed to call the office and go through the proper channels as this is inappropriate, she continued complaining of her abdominal pain. I told her I am driving, out of the office, and not near a laptop so I cannot help her. She then told me she had my Manchester address, just wanted me to be aware she said. I told her she needs to call the office. She got mad at me, told me to go back to driving and hung up""

NPs Manchester address is his home address. He further stated that this same patient reached out to him last year via LinkedIn and he told her at that time that it was an inappropriate method of contacting him.

I discussed this with Melissa Audet and she discovered that Steve's personal information is on several non-NLH listed as his work contact information. We made Steve aware of this and he has taken steps to have this information removed where he was able to.
