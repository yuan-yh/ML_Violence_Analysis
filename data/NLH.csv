RN ensured patient that this current level of care was no longer required and that moving rooms was a good step on his road to recovery. Patient continued to stated that he wasn't leaving his room. Upon asking his reason for not leaving, patient did not respond and simply stared at the RN. Further education by RN on the transfer process led to the patient suddenly attempt to get out of bed and began violently removing clothes and medical devices. RN quickly stopped patient from causing harm from removing devices, attempted education on the importance of the devices and began attempts to replace the gown. A nursing aide entered the room to attempt to help this RN with de-escalation and encouraged patient to put his clothes back on. Attempts were unsuccessful and patient began violently swinging his arms to hit the aide. This RN stepped in to stop patient's arms in which patient grabbed with both hands RN's scrub tip and attempted to pull RN to him. Aide immediately activated the strong line. Patient continued to grasp on RN clothes for approximately 30 seconds despite stern instructions to release RN. Charge RN arrived at bedside for assessment and further de-escalation attempts. Security arrived soon after. Patient continued to ignore Charge RN. However, after a few minutes, patient asked where she wanted him. Patient then stood up from bed, despite instructions from Charge RN to lay back down in bed, replaced gown, and unsteadily walked to bed brought in by transport staff. This RN closely escorted patient to the bed to prevent risk of fall, prepped the bed for transport, then transported the patient to new room on Grant 5. Event was reported to the new bedside RN.

It made me highly anxious.,  ,"I am a transporter, and I was picking up a patient in KPO3 to take to the vascular lab. When I arrived, the nurse said he was all ready and as I was preparing the stretcher I grabbed his pillow from his room as we usually do to make the patient more comfortable during transport. He attempted to corner me in his room and said something along the lines of, ""What the fuck are you doing with my pillow. You bitch! Don't take my stuff, put that back NOW!"". I explained that I was just trying to make him comfortable and put the pillow back on his bed. I asked if he would like a blanket for transport and he screamed ""fuck no!"". Once we left KPO3 he became agitated and asked me to stop adjusting the stretcher (as in switching from neutral to break, etc.). I explained that I unfortunately need to be able to move the stretcher in different settings to ensure a safe transport. Leaving KPO3 there are hills in the hallway, so I warned him every time I adjusted the petal (ex. you have to break on the hill to open the door) and he'd say, ""fuck you"". When we entered the elevator, the patient started screaming about a poster that said, ""are you feeling overwhelmed? "", The patient said, ""I'm gonna take that fucking shit down, fuck that"". He proceeded to try to get off the stretcher, but didn't have enough room so he sat back down and attempted to rip down the poster from the stretcher. When we reached the 2nd floor, I quickly exited the elevator, so I was not in an enclosed space alone with the patient. The patient kept complaining that it was ""too hot in here"" or ""too cold"" and I said, ""I'm sorry"" and he said, ""oh so this is fucking your fault, fuck you"". When we arrived at the vascular lab, I left him in the designated patient area and notified the secretary that the patient is unpredictable and verbally aggressive. I then immediately went to the materials unit to report the incident to my charge and supervisor. I considered hitting my strong line alert during transport as I felt unsafe. I am a new employee and wasn't sure where the line was in regard to whether to hit it or not. I then immediately began writing this incident report.

I was notified by NP of the following: ""So Friday afternoon, I got a phone call at first it was someone who thought they had the wrong number, I was driving didn't think anything of it. Then they sent a text asking if I was ""NP"", I said it was. I got 4 back to back texts, it was a patient I saw at Inland, when I did not respond in the 30 seconds after, she called me. I asked her how she got my number as it is my personal cell phone. She said she found it on the internet. I told her she needed to call the office and go through the proper channels as this is inappropriate, she continued complaining of her abdominal pain. I told her I am driving, out of the office, and not near a laptop so I cannot help her. She then told me she had my Manchester address, just wanted me to be aware she said. I told her she needs to call the office. She got mad at me, told me to go back to driving and hung up""

NPs Manchester address is his home address. He further stated that this same patient reached out to him last year via LinkedIn and he told her at that time that it was an inappropriate method of contacting him.

I discussed this with Melissa Audet and she discovered that Steve's personal information is on several non-NLH listed as his work contact information. We made Steve aware of this and he has taken steps to have this information removed where he was able to.  

Steve has asked that this patient be discharged from his practice due to her inappropriate behavior.",Outpt Practice - Specialties,General Surgery Clinic,  ,,

PT presented back to SVH today to pay a bill for his primary care visit and when central reg immediately notified security of him walking up to the building security, who is well aware of the situation and what the circumstances are,   security stopped the patient and asked if he had an appointment and he said he was here to pay a bill so then he was directed over to the registration desk to pay the bill. He then sat down and made multiple remarks threatening the facility and staff and was trying to get everyone ""riled up"" as he said. He also made remarks saying he was going to, ""take security out to the parking lot and have some fun"". He paid his bill and then proceeded to get up and yell in securities face. Security member   told a Central Reg member not to call PD. Security also said, ""If you felt threatened by that gentleman you should have left your desk or shut your window so I know your in danger because I cant always hear at my desk"". This gentleman was already threatening in the past and was not even supposed to be allowed on the premises unless it was for the emergency room so it was expected that security be with this gentleman during this encounter for safety reasons. The gentleman then proceeded to exit the building audibly laughing and then gave the middle finger towards the hospital all the way to his car. He then left the parking lot laying on the horn the entire time. PD was never called so at this time he is still under a verbal no trespassing order. Multiple central reg members felt threatened by the gentleman and did not appreciate him being allowed into the building and not having security with him and watching him during the encounter.
