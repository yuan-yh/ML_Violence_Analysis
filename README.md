## Overview

Healthcare workers face a disproportionate amount of workplace violence. To address this issue, I conducted a comprehensive analysis that combined structured and unstructured data, applied predictive modeling, and used topic modeling techniques to better understand patterns in violent incidents and inform hospital policies.

## Key Contributions

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and transformed multiple datasets into a unified structure suitable for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Assessed basic statistics related to:
  - **Weather** and **temperature** at the time of incidents.
  - **Moon phases**, **time**, and **date** patterns.
  - **Perpetrators** and **victims** (e.g., patient-on-nurse violence).
  - **Type of violence** (e.g., verbal vs. physical).
- Identified nurses as the most frequently affected role â€” though partly due to their high representation in hospital staffing.
- Found that **emergency departments (ED/ER)** and **behavioral care (BC)** units experience the highest rates of violent events.

### Machine Learning Models
- Built predictive models to classify **violence severity** using:
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
- Evaluated model performance; initial best-performing model was **Decision Tree** with **69.5% accuracy**.

### Semantic Analysis & Advanced ML
- Applied **BERTopic** to extract semantic features from:
  - `Primary Assault Description`
  - `Assault Description`
- Identified meaningful topic clusters such as:
  - *Communication/cooperation/family failure*
  - *Harassment/legal accusation/fighting*
  - *Housing/homelessness/lack of support*
  - *Injurious behavior/self-harm/interference*
  - *Verbal assault/posture/aggression*

- Integrated topic features into machine learning pipeline.
- Chose **XGBoost** for its robustness with imbalanced datasets.
- Final model achieved **78% accuracy**, improving significantly over previous models.

### Key Insights
- Top contributing factors to violent events include:
  - Mental health challenges
  - Communication breakdowns
  - Housing insecurity
  - Staffing/resource limitations
- High-risk populations include:
  - Elderly or confused patients
  - Individuals with mental illness or compliance issues
- Most frequent settings for violence:
  - Emergency Rooms (ED/ER)
  - Behavioral Care (BC) units

## Policy Recommendations
Based on findings, suggested actions include:
- **De-escalation training** for frontline staff.
- **Deployment of mental health professionals** in high-risk units.
- **Improved staffing levels** and **resource allocation** to support high-pressure environments.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Work
- Extend the analysis to assess **post-incident care needs**.
- Use longitudinal data to track impact of implemented policy changes.
- Explore real-time alert systems for high-risk conditions using NLP-triggered monitoring.
