Slide 1: 40s 
Hi everyone, we are the medical team.

Violence against healthcare is becoming a common topic since COVID.

You may think about Luigi, but today we'll focus on those happened in hospitals.

In this project, we’ll analyze where, when, and why violence happens, and most importantly, how to mitigate it.

This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about protecting people who save others. So let’s begin.

--------------

Slide 2: 25s
After 3 previous medical group, I think we all familiar with the background now, so I will jump to the workflow.

We started by merging the given 9 datasets, clean and map into number, performing ML and semantic analysis, then combine for results.

--------------

Slide 3: 25s
Across the dataset, we spotted 1517 valid cases since last year. (which is surprising to me given we are in Maine)

Next we will predict severity, identifying high-risk roles/locations, and extracting hidden themes from descriptions.

--------------

Slide 4: 15s
To begin with, let’s ask a quick question: who dunnit?

As we can see, over 80% of violence is done by patients.

(Inpatient: stay overnight in a hospital for treatment; outpatient: without staying overnight)

--------------

Slide 5: 10s
And unfortunately, nurses are the most impacted healthcare professions, followed by security and then technician.

--------------

Slide 8: 10s
Next you may wonder, is there any time pattern?

When we combine them together, we can spot a higher tendency at business days.

--------------
Slide 10: 15s
We also checked the weather pattern. 

Fun fact about this part: i used concurrency and lru caching to accelerate the weather checking process, so LeetCode worked, though we didn’t see new patterns here.

--------------

Slide 11: 20s
And last is the moon phase, which rejects the idea of ‘lunatic’: no, you won’t be more violent at full moon.

A quick summary so far: if you are a nurse working on Thursday in October when its 50F outside, may be consider taking a PTO?

--------------

Slide 12: 20s
Next, let’s focus on the location: people in clinical units like ED/ER are definitely living in a hard time, suffering more physical and verbal abuse.

Starting from here, let’s step onto a more advanced level.

--------------
Slide 15: 50s
We also applied semantic analysis to process contributing factors and descriptions.

BERTopic was used to group similar descriptions into themes.

The topic model was actually inspired by the showcase yesterday, in which one project used ClinicalBERT for medical prediction.

Next, we created a correlation matrix to see how variables related to each other, which will be shown in a second.

By combining topics in binary flags with structured data, we are ready for the next level.

--------------

Slide 17: 25s
Let’s focus on the severity column.

The `aggressor` feature is the strongest predictor.

Certain types of violence might be associated with lower severity, same for the role of a person involved and higher temperature.

Most features (like `location`, `day`, `month`, `day_of_week`, `Moon Phase`, `topic`) show very weak correlations, which probably don’t significantly influence our target in a linear way.

--------------

Slide 18: 50s
Eventually, we combine the semantic result with other structured data and run the XGBoost model.

There is a little concern, as we noticed the data is not balanced.

As a result, the overall success rate is 78%.

The model performs well at spotting "None" (Class 0), with 91% Precision.

However, for class 1 to 3 which represent moderate / mild / severe, the low F1 score means the model struggles with detecting them.

This is likely caused by class imbalance issues as we mentioned earlier.

--------------
Slide 19: 20s
`Aggressor`, `Violence Type` and `text` are the most important factors for model prediction, so definitely keep those fields in the violence report form.

--------------
Slide 20: 20s
Also we can finally answer the question: why dunnit?

From these two pie charts, we’ve successfully identified `communication`, `mental health challenges`, and `resource limitations` as major root causes.

--------------
Slide 21: 40s
In summary, we were able to answer most questions from our stakeholders. 

Nurses are the most-impacted healthcare professions, and clinical units suffer a higher violence rate.

The root causes include communication breakdowns, mental health challenges, and resource limitations.

Therefore, we propose three recommendations: staff training, mental support,and resource allocation. 

--------------
Slide 22: 30s
But this is not the end.

In terms of future data analysis, we can consider SMOTE for oversampling rare classes.

And in the real world, it’s also important to support those impacted people and to build a safer workplace.

We’d like to thank the instructor and the previous two medical groups for sharing their brilliant insights. 

We are open for questions now.
